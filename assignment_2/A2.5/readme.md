In order to run the two haskell programs prog1.hs and prog2.hs, you need to have haskell installed. Visit https://www.haskell.org/get-started/ to find the proper install method for your os.

step 1) - start  GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler interactive) byt writing the following in your terminal:

        ghci

This will start GHCi and you can now test out some haskell code.

step 2) - load in the haskell programs one at a time (make sure you are in the same directory as the files you want to load):
        :load prog1.hs

step 3) - to evaluate the variable 'mina' type in:
        mina

The same is done for prog2.hs

step 4) - to quit GHCi:
        :q
